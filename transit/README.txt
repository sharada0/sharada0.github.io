A3 - MBTA map and schedule

Correctly Implemented:

I think everything except the polyline has been correctly implemented. 
The polyline does not connect the stations in the right order, and the 
red line fork also has not been implemented.
Otherwise, the rest should be correctly implemented (map, schedule, 
station markers, etc.).

Collaboration / Discussion:

I briefly talked about some aspects with Shriya Nevatia, to clarify 
some questions about the assignment, and I also used the questions and 
answers on Piazza.

Time spent:

I think I spent about 6-8 hours on this assignment.
