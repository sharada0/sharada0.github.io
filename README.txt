A1: MY PORTFOLIO

==================

Correctly Implemented
---------------------
I believe everything specified in the assignment has been correctly
implemented. All pages passed the HTML5 and CSS specifications/validations.
At least 5 rules were used in resume_style.css. The index, resume, and bio
were built according to the specifications, and I did not violate any of
the rules (e.g, not using absolute URLs, etc.).

I think I made commits a little too frequently in this assignment, because 
of an initial misunderstanding, which I have since resolved. I did try to
generally use meaningful messages for the commits, however.

Important Note: Due to privacy reasons, I made up or adjusted certain
information in my resume, bio, etc., including my name, picture, and other
details about me. I asked Ming about this earlier in the week, and he told
me this would not be a problem.


Collaborations
--------------
I discussed the assignment briefly with others in the class, but I 
did not collaborate with any other students. 
I used some of the answers to questions on Piazza to help me, such as
the question about redirecting from the CS page to the github page.
I also used w3schools.com and a few stack overflow questions to 
clear up some questions/confusions I had along the way.


Time Spent
----------
I spent approximately 5-6 hours on this assignment.
